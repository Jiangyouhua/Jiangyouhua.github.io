    content: `Please note that this site was originally in Chinese, but the content displayed is Google Translated.

    Let us do better.
    
    I am a designer. The design software I have mastered are: Photoshop, Illustrator, Corel draw, PageMaker, InDesign, After Effects, Premiere, Corel draw, 3DS MAX, Maya, UG, SketchUp, and many other flat and three-dimensional software. I also learned the Three Musketeers on the web at that time. As long as it is related to design and work, I will learn it all. The feeling is that with Belden, the application of each software is not very different. As a designer, you have to have wonderful ideas.
    
    I am a programmer. The editing languages ​​I master are: ASP, PHP, Javascript, Go, Objective-C, Swift, Dart, MS Sql, MySql, etc. Of course, I also have frameworks such as Flutter and SwiftUI. I have also used C#, Java and Python to develop gadgets. . As long as it is necessary for work, I will learn it all. I also feel that with Belden, the application of each language is not very different. As a programmer, you have to come with rigorous logic.
    
    I have only one way to learn design and editing: use it to make something for yourself, and when you make this thing, then you also learn it.
    
    In 2000, learning Photoshop, I repaired a corroded old photo; learning Illustrator, I drew a Japanese-style cartoon; learning Corel draw, I arranged a company picture album. After three or four months, I found my first design job. Later PageMaker and InDesign were used directly to typeset books in work.
    
    In 2001, I transferred to work in a film and television company in Shenzhen, so I learned three-dimensional and film-related software. Learning 3DS MAX, I designed a fighter plane and made an animation of the fighter plane crossing the sun. Later, when I was learning Maya, I made a puppet with a big head doll. Among them, the operation capability of 3DS MAX is used in the company's bidding scheme for museum design. After Effects and Premiere were learned while helping colleagues.
    
    In 2003, a colleague privately gave me a website, so I picked up the three swordsman webpage. The website was delivered a week later, and a guide page was made with flash. Earned the first extra money in my life, 1,800 yuan. It was also the time I learned HTML and CSS.
    
    In 2004, the company knew that I would develop web pages, and I took over many web services, and I did all of them. The boss saw that I was doing a good job and asked me to create a website for teaching toys called "Tangrenjiaotoy.com". So I started to learn ASP, JavaScript, and VBScript. The website was completed in more than two months, with a backend, a database (Office Access), and the ability to upload products and provide a chat room for pre-sales services.
    
    In the process of learning ASP, the one I visited most was Mars Times. Here, I learned from netizens that it would be more convenient to make a website with PHP. So after 2004, all company websites switched to PHP. During this period, I learned about Joomla and of course Wordpress.
    
    In 2007, my daughter was born and returned to her hometown to be a freelancer at home. Graphic design is more competitive, so I learned UG and CATIA, and used UG as my main software for industrial design. At the same time, I learned SketchUp, the most commonly used software for architectural design. It was also during this time that my graphic design won the Excellence Award in the Fu Liji Roast Chicken National Packaging Design Competition, and the industrial design won the Excellence Award in the Dongguan Cup International Industrial Design Competition.
    
    In 2009, joined a company of freelance clients. The company uses APS.NET. I learned C# and MS Sql to build a foreign crowdfunding website.
    
    In 2010, I learned PHP and GO in the following career as a programmer. When I was learning PHP, I also studied MySQL. I designed and developed a "digital campus system" for the company, which successfully applied for the Beijing Innovation Fund; when I was learning GO, I used GO to imitate Joomla and made a system, which I called JCMS system. The system was later used in the business of the Wuhan company.
    
    In 2014, as the main development member of the company, I learned Objective-C and developed an app called "Magook" of the company, and later used it to develop my own app called "Muutr" due to the poor recruitment of iOS development.
    
    In 2017, I started to learn Swift and Swift UI. I developed a "One English" series of basic education learning apps; at the same time, I started a mac OS desktop program project called "iWriter".
    
    In 2010, I started to learn Dart and Fluttr, and used Flutter to develop an app called "Exam Preparation for the Eight Majors".
    
    I can do many things and do many things, but this is not what I want, I want to do better with you.
    
    Every company has professionals in all aspects, and most companies do not need a generalist. And you can only focus on your own business in a company, otherwise you will not even do this thing well. So for me, I have some regrets. Now that I want to come, I should focus on the places where I need it most. For me, it is a diploma. My technical secondary school diploma makes it extremely difficult for me to find a job. If I focus on improving my diploma, maybe I will not be too embarrassed now.
    
    Hope you can see my strengths.
    
    Let us do better together.`

        I started in April 2017 and decided and developed the project plan.

I was alone and used more than 400 nights to finally make it born. It will be my greatest comfort to be able to go online. Interestingly, during the online test of the target map, I replaced the bug management software with the target map, which feels pretty good.

The project plan is prepared for us.

        The choice is called K language and is the result of Google. A-G are used by others, H is not good, I and J are not conspicuous, so it is called K, which has no other meaning. It seems that there is a guy named K in "Men in Black", which is quite powerful. When you say you want to write in a language, you get excited, but don't get excited, I'm not that good yet. My idea is: use my own way to write C language, this way I call it K language, after writing it, parse it into C language.

        Unfinished, survival is more important.`

    subtitle: "A programmer's long-term thinking on front-end development",
    content: `This site is developed using <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span>.

    <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> was written by me before 2012, and I used it again in 2014 when I wanted to develop a department called "JCMS". In 2014, front-end frameworks such as Angular and React were very popular. When I tried React, I found that React was somewhat similar to my <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> philosophy, so I finally decided to use <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> again in "JCMS". The process of using <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> this time made me think that <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> is quite good. I wanted to share it, so I spent some time to sort it out, set it to version 1.0, and put it on github.
    
    In this way, time passed unconsciously. Until recently, I was planning to develop a project management system called "MPM", which reminded me of <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> again. I went to watch it on github, it was there alone, with few stars. Eight years have passed, and Javascript has a new standard, so I rewrite <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> again, which is a 2.0 version, and then update it on github.
    
    <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> is a better JS framework because it is much simpler than Angular, React, and Vue. Of course, it is not that <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> is better than Angular, React, and Vue, but that they have different missions, so they go in different directions.
    
    What is the direction of <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span>?
    
    You think, in countless front-end programming, we are constantly doing repetitive work, constantly writing navigation bars, banners, lists, graphic previews, full text reading, forms, etc., taking care of every detail. Why can't it be like desktop program development? If I want a list, then I add a list component from the component library, then bind the data, set the parameters, and then process the event. That's it, isn't it great? Yes, this is the direction of <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span>.
    
    <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> hopes to provide you with a series of components. You can select and add them on the page, then bind data, set parameters, and handle events. In this way, you have designed the page you need. I put this page design method as a component design.
    
    How does <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> achieve componentized design?

    First of all, <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> provides three basic classes to support:
    1. The Html class repackages the JS Document to achieve a more convenient way to write Document elements;
    2. Part class, here it is agreed that all developed component classes must inherit the Part class. In this way, it is convenient for users to realize the use of components by binding data, setting references, and handling events in an agreed manner.
    3. Web class, through the analysis of the agreed tags of the page, so that <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> is applied to the page.

    Secondly, <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> provides some basic components:
    1. Provide components for logos, slides, navigation bars, banners, lists, graphic previews, and full text reading on the page;
    2. You can use those components to design your page like this site;
    3. The most important thing is that you can not only develop them based on conventions, but you can also use them on the page without restrictions, or even publish them to share with other users.

    Finally, <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> has an ultimate dream:
    1. There is a shared platform for high-level developers to submit design components.
    2. Users who need it, download the required components, like building blocks, and build the pages they need. This user can be compvar ely zero-based.
    3. When the shared components reach a certain number, you may not need front-end personnel.
    
    <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> is able to do this, and this is my motivation to perfect it again and again.
    
    <span data-source='JPart' data-part='JLogo()'></span> is so easy, you can try to use it in your projects, hopefully you will like it more and more.`,
